## Background
The transportation of items or package delivery within the country are faced with many challenges.  Deadlines and disgruntled customers demanding to know is the status of their shipment make it challenging for these businesses. The problem lies in that increased load hasnâ€™t been matched with the way these businesses run.  Transportation of many items within Tanzania is mostly handled by bus services. Although steps have been made to digitize travel little has been done on how we transport our items and packages.
Most business rely on writing all sent packages on books. This process is time consuming since all documents must be written down in different books. One book at the counter for receiving the packages and another book with the person dispatching the packages. This way of operating is very inefficient and unproductive. In a fast-moving world such inefficient processes will slow down activities. Business may lose customers due to lack of trust and confidence.
Thus, due to these challenges I propose a simple yet effective way to tackle this problem. Using technology readily available these businesses can enjoy benefits of this solution. The solution tries to: 
1.	Reduce time wasted handling the packages.
2.	Gain customer confidence by keeping the customer informed about the status of their packages.
For the first part the Application proposed will centralize the information of sent packages by use of a Web based application that the front office will be updating. Also using QR Codes will improve package tracking. The Application will have a Mobile interface where the QR Codes will be read and data updated almost immediately. This will increase productivity by reducing the amount of time process the package.
Using SMS APIs (provided by Beem) this will tackle the second issue raised. By sending SMS notifications each step of the package delivery customer will be aware his/her package status. Thus, this will definitely restore confidence in the Business.
